            <h4>System Overview</h4>
            <p>The mechanical system consists of three major subsystems:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The frame and all mounted hardware.</li>
              <li>The spools of paper which are the game and the transmission actuating them.</li>
              <li>The system which moves the game charter up and down in response to the player’s controls.</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <div class="span5">

        <div class="row-fluid marketing">
          <div class="span12">
            <p>We found it preferable to divide the entire mechanical system into smaller blocks. There is interplay between the systems, though. The motors which actuate the transmission and game character are mounted to the frame. The timing belt on which the game character moves travels near the rollers. Therefore, we began integration of subsystems around the frame in our earliest CAD iterations. This process of division helped us isolate challenging portions of the design which required more time and energy while still making rapid progress on the system as a whole. Throughout the design process, we strove to produce a system which was robust, user friendly and cost efficient.</p>

            <h4>Frame</h4>
            <p>The frame consists of ¼ inch MDF wood. This has the advantage of being very sturdy and rigid and is able to be laser cut. This allows much higher precision, modularity and repeatability in the project design. The slotted leg design allows for easy assembly. The holes in the frame for the spindles ensure that the transmission has a very ridged platform to actuate. This makes it easier to tension the system. Finally, the frame serves as a box to contain the mechanical and electrical systems. Therefore, there are two bottom plates—one to create a nice ground image for the player and one which encloses all the mechanical workings. This helps present a finished, professional product.</p>

            <h4>Transmission</h4>
            <p>The transmission was the most challenging aspect of the design. Here we encountered a challenge. Our original design idea was to power both spindles. This meant we needed the spindles to simultaneously rotate in opposite directions. This presented a design challenge. Also, the diameter of the spindle changes as the amount of paper on the roll increases and decreases. Therefore, the spindle must travel with fewer revolutions per minute. Our original thought was to employ ratcheting sprockets, and reverse the direction of the chain to make the paper reverse directions. However, we realized this was not good. When the spindle which paper is rolling off becomes too small, it begins spinning faster than the chain moving in the opposite direction, and the ratcheting would no longer occur. The system would seize and the paper would rip. We considered making the spindles sufficiently large that this would never come into play; however, we determined that this would be unwieldy. We next considered a figure 8 belt arrangement or using two motors. However, both of these were less efficient, and higher cost than the system we decided on.</p>
             
            <p>The transmission system we use consists of a pulley on a brush motor and 2 timing belt pulleys mounted underneath two sets of dog tooth gears. The dog tooth gears consist of a series of triangular ridges on the circular face of the gear. When the gears are pushed together by an arm mounted on a servo, the teeth mesh and circular motion translates to the other gear. This allows us to selectively engage the spindle by changing which set of gears are engaged and which set are freely rotating. Therefore, the timing belt always runs in the same direction. This makes operation simpler both mechanically and from a coding perspective.</p>

            <h4>Game Character</h4>
            <p>In side- scroller games, it is necessary for the game character (in our case, a snail) to move up and down in response to player input. Therefore we needed to actuate the snail. This actuation system needed to be discreet so it would not distract the player. Therefore, we decided on an 1/8 inch timing belt being driven by a stepper motor with a timing belt pulley attached to its shaft. This allows for precise positioning control. We located the motor below the plane of the game environment and enclosed it inside the frame. Therefore, it is not a distraction for the player. At the top of the timing belt, we have a roller. This is because only an idler is required as no actuation is occurring at this point. Rollers are far less expensive than pulleys. Further, a roller can be much smaller than a pulley and is therefore less distracting to the player.</p>
