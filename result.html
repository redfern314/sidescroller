          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p>Animated side-scrollers hide the mechanics of motion completely. They assume that: “Why does it move?” is an irrelevant question. Our mechanical side-scroller accepts that the user may enjoy viewing the underworking’s of the device. However, this is only the case if the components are unobtrusive. Therefore, we did not conceal the mechanical components behind walls. Instead, we placed them outside of the normal line of view so they did not create a distraction to the player’s integrated game experience; only an appreciative add-on. </p>
          
          <h4>Design</h4>
          <p>In designing our mechanical system, we attempted to create a seamless  interaction. When you look at the Slime Slider, all the “gut” mechanical pieces are out of the player’s view when they are watching the scroll. We also wanted it to be a fun, engaging experience for the user. Therefore, we did not hide the system. This visibility, we feel, if vital to the essence of the game. </p>
          
          <h4>Specifics</h4>
          <p>This also contributed to our choices in music and lighting. We chose to use ambient light—both for ease of use for the user and to reduce eye strain. The addition of LEDs along the top of the project helped create a carnival like feel. However, if they were too bright, they would be glairing and detract from the user’s experience. To combat this, we made them dim but present by connecting them to the readily available 12 volt rail but wiring them in series. This allows for a very nice, non-irritating effect. With the snail system, we chose an 1/8 inch timing belt so it would be less obtrusive, even though it is harder to mount to. The music was added too to root out player boredom and add excitement. Also, it helps contribute to the carnival like feel and makes the game more compelling  for the user. </p>
            <h4> Reflection </h4>
           <p>If we were to do the project again, it would be preferable to begin integrating sooner. Even if the final mechanical system was not complete, a stand in system which allowed the software team to begin debugging would have been indispensable. This also would have allowed for a more iterative fabrication process. More frequent full team meetings might have assisted with this as would an appointed system lead. </p>
           <p> Also, it would have been better to do more re-design earlier so ordering parts wasn't a lesson in high-speed part integration. This caused some parts to be the incorrect sixe for the project.</p
  <p> Mechanically, speaking, we discovered that timing belt tensioning is extremely important. Therefore, using tracks for motor adjustment is preferable to solid, finite mounting points. Also, using a motor with a pre-installed gear train also ensures there is sufficient torque to turn the spindles. This becomes challenging, especially if the frame or spindles warp or bend and there is more pressure. Secondly, this slows the motors down to a reasonable speed so the paper does not move too fast. As a cost saving measure for the thin timing belt moving the snail up and down, I would investigate the possibility of gears with the appropriate pitch sooner. Gears are much less expensive than timing belt pulleys and work just as well in low torque situations. </p>
<p> From a software perspective, we would begin integrating with the mechanical sub team much sooner to enable more debugging and integration time. Further, we would use the poorly documented, but efficient pygame library. Also, it is much better at event handling than the other options. Using this from the start would resolve many issues. Finally, we would communicate more in development between the vision and event handling so they integrated more smoothly. </p>
<p> In the electrical system, we would power the spindles with an appropriately sized motor, not an oversized one. This would reduce much of our current demand and result in a much easier and faster to develop system. We would also purchase op-amps instead of relying on the low power ones found in the stockroom. </p>

<h4> Final Project versus Original Vision </h4>
<p> The original vision was a much faster, technically ambitious game. While this is still possible, a slower speed seems more fitting. This game feels relaxing. It is beauty through form and transparency. Therefore, the slower speed is now a feature. Secondly, a sparse map matches our lacking art skills but not our original plan. Once again, though, the fewer frills seems fitting. This is a clean, elegant project. It derives character from what it lacks—a screen. Therefore, by using simpler graphics, it helps create a more fully integrated user experience. 
<p> Our original plan was to use ratcheting sprockets. However, these can only be driven in reverse at the feed rate of the paper. After performing calculations, we determined that this method would not work. Therefore we switched over to a dogtooth gear inspired mechanism. Secondly, we switched over to a motor with enclosed gear box when we struggled to tension the timing belt for the much faster motor we originally considered. These design changes allowed our project to function and reduced our fabrication time. </p>
