            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>Animated side-scrollers hide the mechanics of motion completely. They assume that: “Why does it move?” is an irrelevant question. Our mechanical side-scroller accepts that the user may enjoy viewing the underworking’s of the device. However, this is only the case if the components are unobtrusive. Therefore, we did not conceal the mechanical components behind walls. Instead, we placed them outside of the normal line of view so they did not create a distraction to the player’s integrated game experience; only an appreciative add-on. </p>
            
            <h4>Design</h4>
            <p> In designing our mechanical system, we attempted to create a seamless  interaction. When you look at the Slime Slider, all the “gut” mechanical pieces are out of the player’s view when they are watching the scroll. We also wanted it to be a fun, engaging experience for the user. Therefore, we did not hide the system. This visibility, we feel, is vital to the essence of the game. </p>

           <h4>Specifics </h4>
           <p>This also contributed to our choices in music and lighting. We chose to use ambient light—both for ease of use for the user and to reduce eye strain. The addition of LEDs along the top of the project helped create a carnival like feel. However, if they were too bright, they would be glairing and detract from the user’s experience. To combat this, we made them dim but present by connecting them to the readily available 12 volt rail but wiring them in series. This allows for a very nice, non-irritating effect. With the snail system, we chose an 1/8 inch timing belt so it would be less obtrusive, even though it is harder to mount to. The music was added too to root out player boredom and add excitement. Also, it helps contribute to the carnival like feel and makes the game more compelling  for the user.  </p>
           
           <h4> Reflection </h4>
           <p>If we were to do the project again, it would be preferable to begin integrating sooner. Even if the final mechanical system was not complete, a stand in system which allowed the software team to begin debugging would have been indispensable. This also would have allowed for a more iterative fabrication process. More frequent full team meetings might have assisted with this as would an appointed system lead. </p>
           <p> Also, it would have been better to do more re-design earlier so ordering parts wasn't a lesson in high-speed part integration. This caused some parts to be the incorrect sixe for the project.</p>
